## üõ†Ô∏è Built With

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
  This is a React framework that provides features such as server-side rendering and static site generation. It's used for building the user interface of your application. The main configuration for Next.js can be found in next.config.js.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
  This is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. It's used for styling the application. The configuration for Tailwind CSS can be found in postcss.config.js.
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org)
  This is a powerful, open source object-relational database system. It's used for storing application data. The connection to Postgres is likely managed through Prisma.
- [React](https://reactjs.org)
  This is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's used for creating the interactive elements of your application. The React components are located in the components directory.
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io)
  This is an open-source database toolkit. It's used for object-relational mapping, which simplifies the process of writing database queries. Prisma configuration and schema can be found in the prisma directory.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
  This is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It's used to make the code more robust and maintainable. TypeScript definitions and configurations can be found in files like next-env.d.ts and i18next.d.ts.
- [Svix](https://www.svix.com/) (Provides Webhook Orchestration)
  This is a service for handling webhooks. It's used to emit events on user/team CRUD operations, which can then be caught and handled by other parts of the application or external services. The integration of Svix is distributed throughout the codebase, primarily in areas where Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations are executed.
- [Retraced](https://github.com/retracedhq/retraced) (Provides Audit Logs Service)
  This is a service for audit logging and data visibility. It helps track user activities within the application i.e (who did what and when in the application). The usage of Retraced would be dispersed throughout the codebase, likely in the files where important actions are performed.
- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) (Provides E2E tests)
  This is a Node.js library for automating browsers. It's used to run end-to-end tests on the application. The Playwright configuration and tests can be found in the tests directory.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com) (Provides Docker Compose)
  This is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. It's used to containerize the application and its dependencies. The Docker configuration can be found in the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml.
- [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org) (Provides Authentication)
  This is a complete open-source authentication solution for Next.js applications. It's used to handle user authentication and authorization. The NextAuth.js configuration and providers can be found in the pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts file.
